# challenge002

Given existing code, I was tasked with refactoring it so it met accessibility standards so the site would be optimized for search engines.

When i viewed the source code, I found a few things I could improve.

When I viewed the title element, it said title so I changed that.

When I viewed the semantic HTML elements, they were all the same, all divs. I changed the semantic HTML elements so they are more clear.

When I viewed the image elements, I found that they needed accessible alt attributes.

When I checked the links, one was broken, so I fixed it.

There was no meta information so I added some to improve search engine optimization.

### My challenges

I have only one previous experience with changing code and because I am learning, this project took me a while. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what to do, where to start, and getting comfortable with messing up and being able to fix what I had broken. I did a lot of research.

There was a lot I wanted to improve but given time constraints, and my newness to HTML, I could only do so much.
